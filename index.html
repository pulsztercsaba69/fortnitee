<h1>FORTNITE</h1>
<p>Ezek az OG skinek</p>
<p>If you are looking for Fortnite's Rarest Skins then we've got a full list of them right here. While the battle pass skins are unavailable, you will be able to get a chance at grabbing some of these in the item shop!
Rare skins in Fortnite has been a controversial subject. Players that have them don't want them to return because they want the reward of being around in the beginning of the game (OGs). Newer players obviously want to get a chance to grab all the skins they like.
Epic has made an interesting compromise for the Skull Trooper skin. This was a very rare skin and hadn't been in the shop for a year. When they brought it back, they gave OG owners of the skin a style that will not be available for people who buy the skin new. This is a nice way to reward older players, while not keeping popular skins away from people who just got into the game.</p>
<h2>RAREST FORTNITE SKINS & COSMETICS</h2>
<p>These are skins you CANNOT get anymore. They won't be back again unless Epic changes their policy completely. I'm only including the skins from the very first season of Fortnite because we know for sure these are rare. Trying to determine whether or not certain Battle Pass Seasons are rare is impossible. These skins were available for purchase if you got your Season level to a certain point. You could then purchase them with V-Bucks.</p>
